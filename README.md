# PowerShell-SyncCopyFiles
Itâ€™s really hard to say that you can use this in a big environment LOL

This noob project is for my Lobby server

Because i want to copy all needed files to each lobby folder 

So that why you saw i have "Plugins" and "Files"

If you want to use it.. Use it at your own risk lol

But i really have so much fun when i making this, although my brain hurt after going all of this :(
